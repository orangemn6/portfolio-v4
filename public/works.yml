    This current website you are viewing. Built in June 2021, it's the second revision.
    It has JPG, PNG -> WebP conversion, generation of responsive images, and fallback mechanisms.
    The content is stored as markdown files locally in the `src/blogs` folder, 
    and converted to html and undergoes loads of modifications using [JSDOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)
    to appear as good as it looks. Thumbnails are generated using Puppeteer every day in Github Actions.
