    This current website you are viewing 😁. Built in September 2020, it's the second revision.
    It has JPG, PNG -> WebP conversion, generation of responsive images, and fallback mechanisms
    ([Read about it here](https://puruvj.dev/blog/how-i-created-personal-site-part-3)),
    conversion of GIFs to MP4s for performance([Read about it here](https://)). 
    The content is stored as markdown files locally in the `src/blogs` folder, 
    and converted to html and undergoes loads of modifications using [JSDOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)
    to appear as good as it looks. Thumbnails are generated using Puppeteer every day in Github Actions.
