Built in June 2021, it's the second revision. It has JPG, PNG -> WebP conversion, generation of responsive images, and fallback mechanisms. The content is stored as markdown files locally in the `src/blogs` folder,  and converted to html and undergoes loads of modifications using [JSDOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) to appear as good as it looks. Thumbnails are generated using Puppeteer every day in Github Actions.\n","repo":{"url":"https://github.com/orangemn6/portfolio-v4","type":"github"},"image":{"large":{"org":"/assets//works/puruvjdev2/large.png"},"small":{"org":"/assets//works/puruvjdev2/small.png"},"aspectHTW":0.5625}}]
